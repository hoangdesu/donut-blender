# Donut 🍩

> For the last couple of weeks, I decided to spend some of my spare time as we’re approaching Tet holiday on learning something new. Not just another technology or programming language, I wanted to try something completely different this time so I gave 3D design and animation with Blender a shot.

> Little did I know, it was wayyy more mesmerizing than I expected and I got completely hooked to the world of 3D art and creativity. It’s completely opposite to the world of programming that I’m so used to where IDEs and terminals are my day-to-day tools. Yes they have different purposes, but looking at walls of code and console logs might be a little bit…plain and boring sometimes. I would stay up to 3 or 4 am some nights “baking” my donuts and just let my imagination wander freely.

> I thought art and programming are two separate fields, but I was wrong. It’s fascinating to learn that a lot of programming knowledge can be applied in 3D design, especially when working with Geometry Nodes. For those who don’t know, Blender’s Geometry Nodes allow you to modify the geometry of an object by connecting multiple nodes or in programming term - “pre-built functions” - together. I knew a little about other similar visual scripting tools in Unity engine or Blueprints in Unreal engine, but never knew that they’re also commonly used in 3D world. I got caught off guard when Blender Guru showed me how to make rain of sprinkles only from a single plane as you can see in the first shot! Learning Blender and 3D design was definitely a fresh breeze to my experience.
